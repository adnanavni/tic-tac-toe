## How to Play

This is a basic 1v1 Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

1. Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
2. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
3. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
